<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can setup either development environment or production server following the few steps below.

### Make it your own

Start by forking the project on GitHub, so that you can work on your own project.

### Setup a development environment

You must have docker installed on your local machine.  
It is recommended to use VS Code, but not mandatory.

Clone the project on your local machine
```sh
git clone git@github.com:godardth/typescript-fullstack-boilerplate.git # Replace by your own fork
```

Make a copy of the template env file and fill in the configuration
```sh
cp .env-template .env
nano .env
```

Launch the backend and frontend development server
```sh
cd typescript-fullstack-boilerplate
docker compose up
```
Access the [frontend](http://localhost) and [backend](http://localhost:3000)

### Setup a production server

The server-setup.sh script is designed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.  
You also need to have a domain name and DNS configure with subdomains pointing to your server IP.

Clone the project on your server and cd to prod
```sh
git clone git@github.com:godardth/typescript-fullstack-boilerplate.git # Replace by your own fork
cd typescript-fullstack-boilerplate/prod
```

Configure the production server.
```sh
cp .env-template .env
nano .env
```

Startup the production server
```sh
./server-setup.sh
```

After running the previous command, a first build is automatically triggered.  
Wait for the build to complete and launch the remaining services.
```sh
docker compose up api web watchtower -d
```
